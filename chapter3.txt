create remote that connects bach to github repository:
1. git remote add <name> <url> (name=name of repository in git [in general 'origin'], url=url to repopsitory in github [get from github])

how to push changes to github:
1. create files (touch <filename>) (chapter3.txt etc.)
2. create git file (git init)
3. add file to git (git add <file>) (file=. if adding all files)
4. commit changes in files (git commit -m "name of change")
5. push to github (git push origin <branch>)(-u after push if first time for this branch. branch=main if pushing main branch)

create new branch and work with it:
1. create new branch (git branch <branchname>)
2. see the branches (git branch) (the one with * is the branch i am currently in)
3.  switch to different branch (git checkout <branchname>) (branch name=branch to switch to)
