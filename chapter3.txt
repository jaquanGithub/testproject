how to push changes to github:

2. add file to git (git add <file>) (file=. if adding all files that were changed)
3. commit changes in files (git commit -m "name of change")
4. push to github (git push origin <branch>)(-u after push if first time for this branch. branch=main if pushing main branch)

create new branch and work with it:
1. create new branch (git branch <branchname>)
2. see the branches (git branch) (the one with * is the branch i am currently in)
3.  switch to different branch (git checkout <branchname>) (branch name=branch to switch to)

to merge changes from branch into main repository:
1. move to main branch (git branch master)
2. merge the branch (git merge <branch>) (branch=branch to merge into main [master])
3. when pushing to github (after steps in second section above "hot to push...") make to to add to push command -u
